Grid technology has achieved significant advances in the past few years with a
plethora of prestigious organisations contributing to middleware that opens the
horizons for new exploitation opportunities. However, this potential
exploitation has not yet been seen to materialise in emerging applications. The
use of Grid technology is still confined mainly within scientific applications,
developed by scientific organisations, experts in Grid principles.

The majority of IT application developing organisations is still afraid to delve
into the use of Grid technologies, as they still sound new and remote to them.
GREDIA will address this problem with the provision of a Grid application
development platform. This will effectively be a tool which will provide high
level support for the development of Grid business applications through a
completely graphical user interface. The common characteristics of these
business applications are the central concept of a Virtual Organisation and the
demand for access and sharing of large quantities of distributed annotated
numerical and multimedia content. Both desktop and mobile terminals will be
addressed, with advances proposed in the Symbian Operating System relating to
extensions that will facilitate mobile devices to exploit Grid technologies in a
seamless way.

The potential effects of the platform will be validated through two pilot
applications servicing news and banking organisations, demonstrating secure
access to distributed multimedia content in the first case and numerical
annotated data in the second. The consortium includes key technology providers,
established industrial players and leading academic institutions from 7 European
countries along with a world re-known partner in the area of semantic Grid
research from China.

## Our role

We created GridSpace applied as a core of the Appea platform, which
enables users to quickly develop and deploy application scenarios, making use of
the available Grid services and data resources. Moreover, GridSpace is capable
of interfacing end users and present them with custom user interfaces, adapted
to the needs of individual application domains.
