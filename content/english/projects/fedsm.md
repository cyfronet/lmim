The FedSM project is funded by the European Commission in order to improve
service management in federated e-Infrastructures such as Grids and Federated
Clouds. The project has dual aims of making changes in three 'client'
infrastructures to improve their service management maturity and developing
material to assist other infrastructures in making their own improvements.
