The ViroLab Project developed a virtual laboratory for research in the area of
infectious diseases. In particular, it targeted the drug resistance problem in
HIV (Human Immunodefficiency Virus) anti-viral therapy, using genetic
information and computer modeling. GridSpace technology is used here as the main
building block of the virtual laboratory, providing the core runtime, services
and tools for programmers, computational scientists and virologists, enabling
them to address important issues in modern treatment of infectious diseases
through collaborative in-silico research.
