The aim is to build a specialized general-purpose infrastructure for large-scale
computing, enabling the undertaking of research challenges in key areas from the
point of view of Polish society, the scientific community and the economy. The
project is the Polish stage of development of the EuroHPC program. Cyfronet is
the project coordinator and the leader of the Consortium.

## Our role

Our team is involved in task III.1 "Laboratory for the use of supercomputers in
medicine". In this part of the EuroHPC PL project we are designing and
developing a set of tools which will assist scientists involved in computational
medicine in more efficient use of HPC resources. Furthermore, our intent is to
equip medical researchers in ability to compose their complex applications,
configure them to execute efficiently on computational clusters, manage versions
of code and data to support result provenance, and share the effects of their
work with their collaborators, inside their institute or externally.

We are collaborating with medical domain specialists, both medicine doctors and
engineers involved in medical technology, in order to create solutions which fit
their interactive way of conducting computational experiments, e.g. through
Jupiter notebooks. Other tools which are being improved or developed in the
course of this project are Rimrock, PLGData and Model Execution Environment.
