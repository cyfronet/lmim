The MAPPER project responded to the critical need by developing computational
strategies, software and services for distributed multiscale simulations across
disciplines, exploiting existing and evolving European e-Infrastructure. This
project was driven by the computational needs of seven exemplary multiscale
problems from a variety of disciplines including Systems Biology, Fusion,
Physiology, Engineering and nano-Material Science. Mapper used and enhanced
existing solutions to support the multiscale simulation community, building
simulation systems such as GridSpace.
