The Knowledge-based Workflow System for Grid Applications (K-Wf Grid) project
addressed the need for a better infrastructure for the future Grid environment.
The Grid as a vast space of partially-cooperating, partially-competing Grid
services will be a very dynamic and complex environment. In order to address the
complexity in using and controlling the next generation Grid, the consortium
adopted the approaches envisioned by semantic Web and Grid communities in a
novel, generic infrastructure. The K-Wf Grid system assists its users in
composing powerful Grid workflows by means of a rule-based expert system.
