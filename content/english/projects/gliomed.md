Gliomas are incurable despite progress in surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. Specific diagnosis of the type of glioma, early detection of
molecular progression, characterization of critical mutations or epigenetic
characteristics in individual patient give hope to improve treatment results. It
is planned to develop a comprehensive diagnostic test based on analysis of the
material obtained from the tumor via surgery or biopsy (targeted NGS of 700
genes). The Gliomed project will elaborate a liquid biopsy-type method based on
tumor cfDNA in blood, which could be a quick and minimally invasive alternative
to biopsy. The additional aims of the study are: comprehensive molecular
characteristics of tumor genome and transcriptome as well as use of 3-D in vitro
glioma cultures, i.a., under hypoxic conditions for screening of the content of
stem cells and assessment of cells susceptibility to therapy in the environment
of neoplastic niche.

The results will contribute to better understanding of glioma biology, will
allow identification of new molecular biomarkers, potential therapeutic targets
and will provide a practical model to investigate a response to treatment under
hypoxia. Molecular diagnostic test would improve treatment results by therapy
individualization and liquid biopsy will improve safety, comfort and enable to
monitor disease course and treatment in a new way.

## Cyfronet tasks
The Cyfronet team will undertake a series of bioinformatics and biostatistics
analyses on tumor data. Information acquired from MR imaging and NGS sequencing
of glioma cases will be thoroughly investigated to give answer to a set of
challenging questions related to this type of tumor. The result of these
analyses, collaboratively conducted with other project partners, will be the new
liquid biopsy test validation.

Cyfronet will also act as the provider of adequate data storage space and
computational power, to match the requirements of large-scale analyses to be
undertaken in the course of the project. The tools available in the PLGrid
Infrastructure will help the Gliomed researchers in efficient management of
research data and analysis results.
