## Aim
The GEMINI project aims to provide validated multi-organ and multi-scale computational models to support therapeutic decisions and improve fundamental understanding of ischemic and hemorrhagic acute strokes. Precisely, GEMINI will deliver validated, integrated, multi-scale, multi-organ Digital Twin in Healthcare (DTH) models for cerebral blood and cerebrospinal fluid flow, brain perfusion and metabolism, blood flow and thrombosis along the heart-brain axis by integrating available and newly developed dynamic, interoperable and modular computational models.

ACC Cyfronet AGH is responsible for co-creating good practices for producing complex medical computer models, considering their ability to run on HPC resources and standardising their input and output parameters. Based on the prepared practices, virtual twin models will be created, which will then be tested on a large scale - the same model will be used for a large cohort of patients using the HPC infrastructure.
