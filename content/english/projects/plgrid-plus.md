PLGrid Plus project served Polish scientific communities enabling extensive
cooperation among them, as well as international cooperation in the scope of
research activities in the area of e-Science. Preparation of
specific computing environments – so called domain grids – i.e., solutions,
services and extended infrastructure (including software), tailored to the needs
of different groups of scientists, was the most important task implemented
within this 3-year project. The new services, developed within PLGrid Plus,
provided a significant extension of the Polish computing infrastructure, which
had been built since 2008 within the PL-Grid project.
