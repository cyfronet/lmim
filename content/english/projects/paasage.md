PaaSage delivers an open and integrated platform to support model based
lifecycle management of Cloud applications. The platform and the accompanying
methodology allow model-based development, configuration, optimisation and
deployment of existing and new applications, independently of the existing Cloud
infrastructures.

DICE Team developed and integrated HyperFlow worklfow engine with PaaSage
framework. With the use of [CAMEL](https://camel-dsl.org) the HyperFlow engine,
the worker nodes and
application executables can be described in a single model, which can be
deployed on multiple clouds. The deployed application scales automatically based
on the scalability rules defined in CAMEL. The workflow engine was successfully
demonstrated together with MD application from [HLRS](https://www.hlrs.de) project partner.
