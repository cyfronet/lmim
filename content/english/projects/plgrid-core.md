The main objective of the PLGrid Core project is further, significant extension
of the PL-Grid Infrastructure computing resources, especially in ACC Cyfronet
AGH, as a specialized competence centre in the field of distributed computing
infrastructures, with particular emphasis on grid technologies, cloud computing
and platforms supporting computations on big data.

As a result of work carried out in PLGrid Core, a great computing power and huge
storage for digital data will be offered to users. Moreover, they will obtain
access to a set of basic services allowing for easier integration of their
solutions, specific to the selected fields of science, with the PL-Grid
Infrastructure. These services will include:
  * uniform access to distributed data,
  * a Platform as a Service (PaaS) Cloud for scientists, in which different
    domain-specific computing environments will be available in the PaaS model to
    the end-users, enabling flexible scalability and more efficient use of the IT
    infrastructure,
  * applications maintenance environment of MapReduce type,
    facilitating computations using BigData paradigm.

In addition, a set of end-user
services will be developed within PLGrid Core, including: technologies and
environments implementing the Open Science paradigm, a computing environment for
interactive processing of scientific data, a platform for development and
execution of large-scale applications organized in a workflow, a tool enabling
automatic selection of scientific literature, and an environment supporting data
farming mass computations.
