Sano Centre, created in Kraków, Poland, in the framework of Teaming for
Excellence Phase 2 action, as well as the FNP
[International Research Agendas](https://mab.fnp.org.pl)
competition and with a financial support from the Polish Ministry of Science and
Higher Education, will be a major driver for European advancement in rapidly
growing field of computational medicine, developing sophisticated engineering
methods for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, and meeting the
overarching worldwide need for radically streamlined healthcare systems.

{{< youtube ZxLkPIYCGQk >}}

The Sano's area of operation is computational medicine:
  * clinician-led activity can be radically reduced by migrating the majority of
    routine clinical assessments toward computationally-driven,
  * entirely new approaches to disease diagnosis and management follow the
    development of novel computed biomarkers of disease, personalised to the
    individual patient, and typically leading to dramatically reduced costs.

The Sano Centre combines expertise in machine-learning based decision science
with fundamental biomarker identification using advanced simulation and data
analysis methods.

When fully developed, the Centre will act as a core technology provider for
industry, fostering modernisation, innovation and increasing productivity, and
additionally it will act as a catalyst, attracting new investment and
businesses. It will provide an essential link between computational, medical
sciences and the industrial sector, thus fostering knowledge and technology
transfer and accelerating innovation.

Sano was established in Kraków because of several local advantages with regard
to the education and research infrastructure, the high concentration of research
hospitals and a dynamic entrepreneurial community in life sciences, so being
embedded in a highly dynamic and competitive ecosystem.

The Centre will provide a fully sustainable mix of three advanced technical
services, loosely categorised as education, project participation and industrial
product development, with these three strands ultimately contributing
approximately equally to the Centre’s income stream.
