PRIMAGE proposes a cloud-based platform to support decision making in the
clinical management of malignant solid tumours, offering predictive tools to
assist diagnosis, prognosis, therapies choice and treatment follow up. This will
be based on the use of novel imaging biomarkers, in silico tumour growth
simulation, advanced visualisation of predictions with weighted confidence
scores and machine-learning based translation of this knowledge into predictors
for the most relevant, disease-specific, Clinical End Points.

PRIMAGE implements a hybrid cloud model, comprising the of use of open public
cloud (based on EOSC services) and private clouds, enabling use by the
scientific community (facilitating reuse of de-identified clinical curated data
in Open Science) and also suitable for future commercial exploitation. The
proposed data infrastructures, imaging biomarkers and models for in silico
medicine research will be validated in the application context of two paediatric
cancers, Neuroblastoma (NB, the most frequent solid cancer of early childhood)
and the Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG, the leading cause of brain
tumour-related death in children). These two paediatric cancers are relevant
validation cases given their representativeness of cancer disease, and their
high societal impact, as they affect the most vulnerable and loved family
members.

The European Society for Paediatric Oncology, two Imaging Biobanks and three of
the most prominent European Paediatric oncology units are partners in this
project, making retrospective clinical data (imaging, clinical, molecular and
genetics) registries accessible to PRIMAGE, for training of machine learning
algorithms and testing of the in silico tools´ performance. Solutions to
streamline and secure the data pseudonymisation, extraction, structuring,
quality control and storage processes, will be implemented and validated also
for use on prospective data, contributing European shared data infrastructures.

## Cyfronet tasks

The Cyfronet team will be involved directly in development, integration and
support for high-performance execution environment for large-scale multi-model
simulations. This solution will be provisioned by our team to the consortium
members using the PLGrid Infrastructure for e-Science, and specifically, the
Prometheus supercomputer. We will assist our partners in efficient usage of
computational power and disk storage, and we will perform integration of
Cyfronet tools and solutions with these provided by other technology providers
within the project.
