The project will develop a Business Case to establish in Poland Europe's first
Centre for simulation-driven healthcare Decision Support. The Centre's mission
comprises development of new computation-based solutions for diagnostics and
therapy in daily healthcare to improve personalised patient treatment, enhanced
growth of SMEs which deal with technologies and services for novel personalised
diagnostics and treatment strategies, as well as strong advancement of
algorithms, models and technologies involved in personalised medicine.

The project aims to develop a Business Plan establishing the Centre and enabling
it to achieve measurable success through introduction of a number of solutions
based on computational models to clinical trials, development of a number of new
market-ready products and services based on innovations, authoring highly cited
scientific papers, obtaining patents and securing grants.

The Plan will be based on the Polish Specialisation Strategy and will be
elaborated by two Polish partners:
[ACC Cyfronet AGH](http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/en)
(experts in simulation and
computing infrastructures for science) and
[Klaster LifeScience Kraków](http://lifescience.pl/en) (top
cluster of industry, academia and hospitals in the life sciences domain), in
collaboration with the
[University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk) and
[Insigneo Institute](http://insigneo.org) (experts
in translation of in silico modelling and simulations to clinics),
[Forschungszentrum Jülich](http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/DE/Home/home_node.html)
(experts in innovative HPC and data techniques for
science and industry) and
[Fraunhofer ISI](http://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/isi-en/index.php)
(experts in systemic multi-domain solutions and innovation in medicine).
