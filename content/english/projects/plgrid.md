The goal of the PL-Grid project was to provide the Polish scientific community
with an IT supercomputing platform and a set of advanced tools to enable
e-science research in various fields. This infrastructure is compatible with
existing worldwide Grid frameworks. GridSpace2 is positioned as the basis for an
advanced virtual laboratory environment for in-silico processing by Polish
scientists, state authorities and crisis management teams.
