The European Research Network on Foundations, Software Infrastructures and
Applications for large scale distributed, GRID and Peer-to-Peer Technologies.

The programme of the Project was structured around six complementary research
areas that have been selected on the basis of their strategic importance, their
research challenges and the recognised European expertise to develop next
generation Grid middleware, namely:
  * Knowledge & Data Management,
  * Programming Models,
  * System Architecture Grid,
  * Information and Monitoring Services,
  * Resource Management and Scheduling,
  * Problem Solving Environments, Tools and GRID systems.
