The Collage Authoring Environment is a framework for collaborative preparation
and publication of so-called executable papers. The environment enables
researchers to seamlessly embed chunks of executable code (called snippets) into
scientific publications, and to facilitate repeated execution of such snippets
on underlying computing and data storage resources.
