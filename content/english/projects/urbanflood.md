The mission of the UrbanFlood project was investigating the use of sensors
within flood embankments to support an online early warning system, real time
emergency management and routine asset management. The Common Information Space
(CIS) provides a means for integration, over the Internet, of Early Warning
Systems, sensors and application programs for public information and decision
support.
