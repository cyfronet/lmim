The gSLM project aimed to improve Service Level Management (SLM) in the grid
domain. SLM is a set of tools and processes widely used in the commercial sector
to agree, define and measure the provision of a service. In the grid domain SLM
can make it easier for grid resource owners, operators and representatives of
user groups to agree upon, document and manage the many agreements between
stakeholders required to make the grid run smoothly. By bringing together
experts in grid operations and management with leading members of the IT Service
Management community, the project aimed to generate new approaches and concepts
for grid SLM.
