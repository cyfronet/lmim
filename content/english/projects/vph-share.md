VPH-Share develops the organisational fabric and integrates optimized services
to:
  * expose and share data and knowledge,
  * jointly develop multiscale models for the composition of new VPH workflows,
  * facilitate collaboration within the VPH community.

Four flagship workflows (representing @neurIST, euHeart, VPHOP and Virolab
projects) provide existing data, tools and models, engaging with the services
developed by VPH-Share to drive the development of
the infostructure and pilot its applications. Data sources are usually clinical
data from individual patients – medical images and/or biomedical signals –
sometimes with population information. Operations range from secure access and
storage through annotation, data inference and assimilation, to complex image
processing and physics-based mathematical modelling, to data reduction and
representation.
