The subject of this paper is a detailed analysis and development of security in MOCCA, a CCA-compliant Grid component framework build over H2O, a Java-based distributed computing platform. The approach is to extend H2O with an authentication mechanism that will be both secure and compliant with solutions commonly used in modern Grid systems. The proposed authenticator is based on asymmetric cryptography with additional features provided by the Grid Security Infrastructure - proxy certificates that are used for Single Sign-On and delegation. The developed GSI Authenticator was subjected to threat analysis and performance tests, which proved its safety and usability.
