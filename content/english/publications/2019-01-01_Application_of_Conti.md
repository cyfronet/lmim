This paper provides the algorithm that applies concept of continuous time quantum walks to image segmentation problem. The work, inspired by results from its classical counterpart~[9], presents and compares two versions of the solution regarding calculation of pixel-segment association: the version using limiting distribution of the walk and the version using last step distribution. The obtained results vary in terms of accuracy and possibilities to be ported to a real quantum device. The described results were obtained by simulation on classical computer, but the algorithms were designed in a way that will allow to use a real quantum computer, when ready.
