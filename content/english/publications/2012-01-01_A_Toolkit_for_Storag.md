In this paper, we present a toolkit named FiVO/QStorMan for supporting data-intensive applications in distributed environments with storage-related Quality of Service provisioning. Main features of the toolkit are: explicit definition of non-functional requirements regarding storage resources, usage of semantic descriptions of the available storage infrastructure and active monitoring data concerning the infrastructure workload and users operations. In particular, we describe user interfaces of the toolkit along with descriptions of main parts of the toolkit. In addition, the paper describes results of the performed experimental evaluation of the toolkit which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the storage-related QoS provisioning.
