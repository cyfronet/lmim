The Polish Grid Initiative commenced in 2009 as part of the PL-Grid project funded within the framework of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme. The main objective is to provision a persistent heterogeneous computational platform for the Polish scientific community with a unified interface, enabling easy access to the distributed large-scale computing infrastructure. The project establishes a countrywide computing platform which supports scientific research through integration of experimental data and results of advanced computer simulations carried out by geographically distributed computer infrastructure and teams. The solutions applied in setting up this e-infrastructure facilitate integration with other, similar platforms around the world.
