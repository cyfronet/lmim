The Brassica Information Portal (BIP) is a centralised repository for brassica phenotypic data. The site hosts trait data associated with brassica research and breeding experiments conducted on brassica crops, that are used as oilseeds, vegetables, livestock forage and fodder and for biofuels. A key feature is the explicit management of meta-data describing the provenance and relationships between experimental plant materials, as well as trial design and trait descriptors. BIP is an open access and open source project, built on the schema of CropStoreDB, and as such can provide trait data management strategies for any crop data. A new user interface and programmatic submission/retrieval system helps to simplify data access for researchers, breeders and other end-users. BIP opens up the opportunity to apply integrative, cross-project analyses to data generated by the Brassica Research Community. Here, we present a short description of the current status of the repository.
