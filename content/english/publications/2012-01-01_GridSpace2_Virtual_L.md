This work presents the implementation of a method, originally proposed by Hillebrand et al. [1], of quantitative analysis of the grain morphology in self-assembled hexagonal lattices. This method can be effectively used for investigation of structural features as well as regular hexagonal arrangement of nanoporous alumina layers formed on the metal surface during the self-organized anodization process. The method has been implemented as a virtual experiment in the GridSpace2 Virtual Laboratory [15] which is a scientific computing platform developed in the scope of the PL-Grid [9] project. The experiment is a GridSpace2 pilot and therefore made available to the wider community of PL-Grid users. It is both editable and executable through a web portal offered by the GridSpace2 Experiment Workbench [17], dedicated to PL-Grid users. Moreover, since all GridSpace2 experiments are embeddable on arbitrary web sites owing to the Collage [16] feature, the final version of the experiment has been published as an executable publication [18] with execution rights granted to all PL-Grid users.
