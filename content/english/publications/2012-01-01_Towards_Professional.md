Management of large distributed IT infrastructures requires a Service Operations framework covering day-to-day maintenance. In this chapter we describe the Service Operations model developed in the PL-Grid project. First, we sketch the processes that needed to be covered by Service Operations. Subsequently, we present the management solutions worked out in PL-Grid and describe how they were influenced by the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). We also show how to adapt ITIL rules to manage geographically and administratively distributed infrastructures, namely those providing grid resources to the academic community. We claim that adapting a certain Service Operations model is a prerequisite of developing a mature infrastructure, ensuring user satisfaction.
