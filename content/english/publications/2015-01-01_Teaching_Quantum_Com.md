Recently, the idea of quantum computation is becoming more and more popular and there are many attempts to build quantum computers. Therefore, there is a need to introduce this topic to regular students of computer science and engineering. In this paper we present a concept of a course powered by the Quantum Integrated Development Environment (QuIDE), the new quantum computer simulator that joins features of GUI based simulators with inter- preters and simulation library approach. The idea of the course is to put together theoretical aspects with practical assignments realized on the QuIDE simulator. Such an approach enables studying a variety of topics in a way understandable for this category of students. The topics of the course included understanding the concept of quantum gates, registers and a series of algorithms: Deutsch and Bernstein-Vazirani Problems, Grover's Fast Database Search, Shor's Prime Factorization, Quantum Teleportation and Quantum Dense Coding. We describe results of QuIDE assessment during the course; our solution scored more points in System Usability Scale survey then the other tool previously used for that purpose. We also show that the most useful features of such a tool indicated by students are similar to the assumptions made on the simulator functionality.
