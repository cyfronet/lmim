One of the key concept of Grids – as stated in their definition – is providing nontrivial quality of service. However, there are many users whose specific needs for guaranteed resources (depending on the type of their applications and research schedule) are not satisfied. This fact is the main motivation for introducing Service Level Management in the Polish National Grid Infrastructure (PL-Grid). The paper presents a model of SLAs with quality properties required in HPC Grid. In order to properly manage these SLAs a negotiation process has been proposed. Finally, an implementation of the procedures and tools needed to support this processes is summarized.
