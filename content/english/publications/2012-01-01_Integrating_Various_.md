The PL-Grid project is constructing a grid computing infrastructure supporting mature middleware suites such as gLite and UNICORE, as well as new ones like QosCosGrid. It also delivers various services, e.g. graphical tools and databases. Users need to be able to access all services and resources in a uniform way, if possible – with a single set of credentials. PL-Grid integrates the middleware and services accessible to users by delivering a coherent platform upon which to interact with the services. The required integration of procedures and tools is described in this chapter. The resulting platform provides the scientists conducting research with a wide variety of powerful tools and resources, enabling them to maximize their scientific potential.
