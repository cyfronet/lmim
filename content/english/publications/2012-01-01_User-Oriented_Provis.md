The chapter presents a system for effective provisioning of VM Sets and supporting the dialog between providers and end users. VM Sets are networks of interconnected virtual appliances. Requirements for user-oriented provisioning of VM Sets are presented and an infrastructure supporting this activity is described. Stages of the VM Set provisioning process are defined and their functionality is described. Subsequently, manageability aspects are presented with special focus on runtime aspects. The implementation status of the VM Set provisioning environment within the PL-Grid Project is also reported.
