Exascale services bring new unique challenges that the current computational, big data and workflow solutions are unable to meet. The chapter includes a detailed description of selected exascale services with known state of the art in extreme date solutions. The integration of requirements and the analysis of the state of the art in the exascale field is centered in on a description of a high-level architectural approach. The next main contribution of the paper is the description of the architecture capable to handle heterogeneous exascale services coming from both academic as well as industrial sphere. Those two models represent a (conceptual, and technological) design of a platform that addresses the requirements of the use cases. The resulting architecture will help us provide computing solutions to exascale challenges within the H2020 project PROCESS.
