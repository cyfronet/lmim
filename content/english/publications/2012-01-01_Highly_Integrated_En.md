QosCosGrid infrastructure has been prepared, introduced successfully on multiple clusters and comprehensively tested. In order to enhance user experience and increase usability, a set of additional tools must be prepared. Profiting from distributed software becomes more popular nowadays, but the number of tools supporting developers of parallel programs is still smaller than developers’ needs. Eclipse PTP is the leading open source tool among Integrated Development Environments for distributed software. In this chapter we shortly present Eclipse PTP and related Eclipse plug-ins aiding programmers in developing parallel software. Later we describe how QosCosGrid middleware has been integrated with Eclipse PTP. We present the plug-in basic concepts, such as the Resource Manager or Remote Services, general architecture, functionality of the PTP QCG plug-in and advantages over other solutions of this kind.
