ACARM-ng is an extensible, plug-in-based alert correlation framework. It introduces abstractions over correlation, reporting, reaction, gathering data from multiple sources and data storage. ACARM-ng supports real-time reporting, meaning that alerts can be reported while still being correlated. For an administrator, a Web User Interface is provided, to present gathered and correlated data in a consistent way. The system makes use of multi-core architectures and is written in C++.
