The aim of the paper is to study the problem of absentminded driver in the quantum domain. In the classical case, it is a well-known example of a decision problem with imperfect recall that exhibits lack of equivalence between mixed and behavioral strategies. The optimal payoff outcome is significantly lower than the maximum payoff appearing in the game. This raises the question whether a quantum approach to the problem can increase the strategic position of the decision maker. The results that we present in the paper clearly reveal the benefits from playing the absentminded problem with the aid of quantum objects. Through appropriately chosen initial quantum state, the unitary strategies enable the decision maker to obtain the maximum possible payoff. At the same time, our scheme comes down to the classical problem with a suitable restriction of unitary strategies.
