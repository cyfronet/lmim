Large-scale applications expressed as scientific workflows are often grouped into ensembles of inter-related workflows. In this paper, we address a new and important problem concerning the efficient management of such ensembles under budget and deadline constraints on Infrastructure- as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. We discuss, develop, and assess algorithms based on static and dynamic strategies for both task scheduling and resource provisioning. We perform the evaluation via simulation using a set of scientific workflow ensembles with a broad range of budget and deadline parameters, taking into account uncertainties in task runtime estimations, provisioning delays, and failures. We find that the key factor determining the performance of an algorithm is its ability to decide which workflows in an ensemble to admit or reject for execution. Our results show that an admission procedure based on workflow structure and estimates of task runtimes can significantly improve the quality of solutions.
