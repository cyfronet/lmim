The GridSpace2 environment, developed in the scope of the PL-Grid Polish National Grid Initiative, constitutes a comprehensive platform which supports e-science applications throughout their entire lifecycle. Application development may involve multiple phases, including writing, prototyping, testing and composing the application. Once the application attains maturity it becomes operable and capable of being executed, although it may still be subject to further development – including actions such as sharing with collaborating researchers or making results publicly available with the use of dedicated publishing interfaces. This paper describes each of these phases in detail, showing how the GridSpace2 platform can assist the developers and publishers of computational experiments.
