This chapter provides a brief overview of the UNICORE grid middleware and its utilization in the large Distributed Computing Infrastructure. UNICORE framework, in its recent version implements key grid standards and specifications. The system architecture and capabilities, such as security, workflow and data management are described. The installation of the UNICORE environment in the PL-Grid is presented. Special attention is given to the integration of the UNICORE middleware with the PL-Grid authentication and authorization framework which allows for uniform infrastructure and user management across different middlewares. The solutions for monitoring and accounting of the UNICORE infrastructure is presented.
